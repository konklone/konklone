      <strong>Eric Mill</strong> is a leader and technology expert in Washington, DC, creating better public services and smarter policy.

      Eric was previously part of <a href="https://www.gsa.gov">the U.S. General Services Administration</a> and its <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a> team, where he led the U.S. government's adoption of strong encryption (HTTPS) for all public federal web services. Eric also oversaw <a href="https://www.login.gov">Login.gov</a>, which offers secure, private authentication to millions of people accessing US public services.
